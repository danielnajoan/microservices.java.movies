## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies with Maven dependencies:

- **Java 17**: The programming language used for implementing the microservices.
- **Spring Boot**: A framework that simplifies the development of Java-based microservices.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access layer implementation and management in Java applications.
- **Spring Web**: Provides support for building web applications.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used for data persistence.
- **Lombok**: A Java library that helps to reduce boilerplate code.
- **Spring Boot Test**: Provides support for testing Spring Boot applications.
- **SpringDoc OpenAPI**: A tool for generating API documentation based on Spring Boot applications.
- **Hibernate Validator**: Provides validation capabilities for entities in Java applications.

These technologies are utilized to create a robust microservices architecture for managing movie-related information efficiently.

Maven is used for dependency management and building the project.

## Usage with Swagger and SpringDoc OpenAPI

This section provides details on how to use the Swagger API documentation generated by SpringDoc OpenAPI for the `MovieController`.

1. Access the Swagger UI:

   After running the application, navigate to the Swagger UI endpoint to access the API documentation:
   http://localhost:8081/microservices-java-movies/swagger-ui/index.html

2. Explore Movie API Endpoints:

In the Swagger UI, you will find the available endpoints for the Movie API under the "Movie" section. Here's a brief overview of the endpoints:

- **Get All Movies**: Retrieve a paginated list of all movies.
- **Get Movie by ID**: Retrieve a movie by its ID.
- **Create Movie**: Create a new movie.
- **Update Movie by ID**: Update an existing movie by its ID.
- **Delete Movie by ID**: Delete a movie by its ID.

3. Test Endpoints:

Use the Swagger UI to test each endpoint by providing the required parameters and sending requests.

- For example, to create a new movie, provide the necessary movie details and click "Try it out!".

4. Review Responses:

View the responses to each API call within the Swagger UI to understand the structure and format of the API responses.

5. Explore Request Payloads:

Understand the required request payloads and parameters for each API endpoint by examining the "Request Body" and "Parameters" sections in Swagger UI.

Explore the API documentation to learn more about the available movie-related operations and how to interact with them.

For additional details on each endpoint's functionality and usage, refer to the Swagger documentation provided in the Swagger UI.
